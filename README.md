# Skellago

Skellago is a skeleton for web APIs which can be easily used by [Skella](https://github.com/podipo/skella/).

It uses [Negroni](http://negroni.codegangsta.io/) hosted in [Docker]() containers.

TODO

- write a simple negroni app
- install grunt et al and convince it to build and manage containers
