# Skellago

Skellago is a skeleton for web API back ends.  It is designed to work with front ends created by [Skella](https://github.com/podipo/skella/).

# Technologies

Back end logic is written in [Go](http://golang.org/) using the [Negroni](http://negroni.codegangsta.io/) framework and is hosted in [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers.  Skellago also provides a JSON description of the API as well as a [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) wrapper.
